          Chapter 1: What is a 3D Model?
        </div>
        <div id='model1' class="collapsible-content">
          <p>A 3D model is a digital representation of an object in three dimensions — width, height, and depth. Unlike a flat image or drawing, a 3D model can be viewed and 
            rotated from any angle, making it ideal for creating physical objects with a 3D printer.</p> 
          <p> Most 3D models are made up of a mesh, which is a collection of tiny triangles (called polygons) connected together to form the surface of the object. 
            The smoother the surface, the more triangles are used.</p> 
          <p> These files usually come in formats like <strong>.STL </strong>(the most common format for 3D printing, stores only the shape of the object), <strong>.OBJ </strong>(Similar to STL, but also supports color, textures, and material data), 
            or <strong>.3MF </strong>(modern format designed for 3D printing, storing more detailed information like color, materials, and print settings).</p>

      Chapter 3: How to Use 3D Models?
    </div>
    <div id='model3' class="collapsible-content">
      <p>Once you’ve found and downloaded a 3D model (usually in <code>.STL</code> or <code>.3MF</code> format), you’re ready to start the journey from digital file to physical object. But before you can hit “print,” there are a few important steps to follow.</p>

   <br> <stong>1. Import into a Slicer</stong>
    <p>You’ll need a <strong>slicer</strong>—a program that prepares your model for the printer by converting it into layers and generating G-code, the instructions your printer follows.</p>
    <p><strong>Popular slicer programs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ultimaker Cura</strong> – beginner-friendly and supports many printers</li>
      <li><strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> – great for Prusa printers and many others</li>
      <li><strong>Bambu Studio</strong> – optimized for Bambu Lab printers</li>
    </ul>

    <br><stong>2. Adjust Print Settings</sttrong>
    <p>In the slicer, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scale</strong>, <strong>rotate</strong>, or <strong>duplicate</strong> your model</li>
      <li>Set print parameters like <strong>layer height</strong>, <strong>infill</strong>, and <strong>supports</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>More details on these settings are covered in the “3D Printer” chapter.</p>

    <br><stong>3. Check for Errors</stong>
    <p>Some models may have issues like holes or bad geometry that can cause failed prints.</p>
    <p><strong>Helpful repair tools:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microsoft 3D Builder</strong> – simple and built into Windows</li>
      <li><strong>Netfabb</strong> – online repair by Autodesk</li>
      <li><strong>Meshmixer</strong> – good for mesh editing and repair</li>
      <li>Many slicers (like Cura) include auto-repair features</li>
    </ul>

    <br><stong>4. Send to Printer</stong>
    <p>Once sliced, export your G-code and transfer it to the printer using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SD card</strong> or <strong>USB stick</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, if your printer supports it</li>
      <li><strong>USB cable</strong>, in some setups</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then hit "print" and watch your model come to life!</p>

    <div class="tip" style="background-color:#f9f9f9; border-left:4px solid #4CAF50; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
      <br><strong>Extra Tip:</strong> Check user comments and photos where you downloaded the model. Community feedback can help you avoid issues before printing.

    Chapter 4: Fundamentals of 3D Modelling (Experienced)
  </div>
  <div id="model5" class="collapsible-content">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      3D modelling is the process of creating a digital representation of a physical object using specialized software. In this chapter, we’re going to look at how 3D models are built, what terminology you’ll encounter, and how geometry and modeling tools work together to produce printable results. You’ll also get introduced to two commonly used free modeling platforms: TinkerCAD and SketchUp.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Terms and Definitions</h3>
    <p>Before we get into practical use, here are essential terms you'll come across:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vertex</strong> – A single point in 3D space. Multiple vertices connect to form edges.</li>
      <li><strong>Edge</strong> – A straight line between two vertices.</li>
      <li><strong>Face</strong> – A flat surface bounded by edges. Most 3D models are made up of triangular or quadrilateral faces.</li>
      <li><strong>Mesh</strong> – A collection of vertices, edges, and faces that defines the shape of a 3D object.</li>
      <li><strong>Extrude</strong> – A function that turns a 2D shape (like a circle) into a 3D object (like a cylinder) by giving it depth.</li>
      <li><strong>Boolean Operations</strong> – Functions that combine objects (union), subtract one from another (difference), or find the shared space (intersection).</li>
      <li><strong>Manifold (Watertight)</strong> – A 3D model that is completely enclosed, with no holes or non-connected edges. This is required for 3D printing.</li>
      <li><strong>Normals</strong> – Directions assigned to faces. All normals should point outward for printable objects.</li>
      <li><strong>Parametric Modeling</strong> – A method of designing where dimensions and constraints can be changed later, updating the model automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding these terms is essential for interpreting software commands and fixing issues during modeling or slicing.
    </p>

    <h3>Free Modelling Software: Pros and Cons</h3>
    <p>You don't need to start with expensive software. There are several free 3D modeling tools available that are fully capable of producing printable models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TinkerCAD</strong><br>
          Pros: Very easy to use, browser-based, perfect for beginners and quick prototyping. Shape-based modeling with drag-and-drop.<br>
          Cons: Limited in precision and complexity. Difficult to manage advanced shapes or curved surfaces.
      </li>
      <li><strong>SketchUp (Free Web Version)</strong><br>
          Pros: Good for architectural and spatial design, clean interface, simple tools for accurate line and surface control.<br>
          Cons: Not designed for engineering or mechanical design. Managing small components can be tricky. STL export requires a plugin.
      </li>
      <li><strong>FreeCAD</strong><br>
          Pros: Full parametric modeling, excellent for mechanical parts, open-source and regularly updated.<br>
          Cons: Steeper learning curve, interface less polished, occasional bugs.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Blender</strong><br>
          Pros: Powerful mesh and sculpting tools, great for artistic and organic shapes.<br>
          Cons: Overkill for simple mechanical parts, complex UI, and not focused on precision CAD-style modeling.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each tool has a role, depending on whether you’re designing art, prototypes, or mechanical components. For this tutorial, we’ll focus on TinkerCAD and SketchUp for their balance of simplicity and power.
    </p>

    <h3>Geometry and Its Relevance in 3D Modelling</h3>
    <p>
      All 3D models are built from geometric primitives—shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders—and then modified into more complex forms.
      Geometry is not just visual; it determines how your model behaves during slicing and printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solid object in modeling software must be “watertight.” If your shape has gaps or disconnected faces, your slicer won’t generate a correct toolpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complexity of geometry also affects print time and model stability. Overly detailed meshes with thousands of faces may slow down processing and printing unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flat surfaces and clean edges are ideal for accurate fitting parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curved or sculpted surfaces require more careful modeling and slicing settings to preserve detail without overloading your printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding how to construct geometry effectively leads to more reliable prints and makes post-processing easier.
    </p>

    <h3>Using TinkerCAD and SketchUp</h3>
    <h4>TinkerCAD</h4>
    <p>
      Start by combining basic shapes: drag a box and cylinder onto the workplane, resize them, and use the group function to merge them into a single object.
      Try subtracting a cylinder from a cube to make a hole using the hole tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      TinkerCAD is especially useful for simple brackets, enclosures, and household tools. Because it works directly in your browser and saves to the cloud, it’s great for fast iterations.
    </p>

    <h4>SketchUp</h4>
    <p>
      Open a new project and begin by drawing a 2D shape using the line or rectangle tool. Use the Push/Pull tool to extrude it into a 3D object.
      With SketchUp’s snapping and measurement tools, you can quickly align parts, define edges, and control sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This environment works well for furniture design, architectural models, or visual layouts.
      You’ll notice that SketchUp thinks in “faces” and “edges,” which is different from TinkerCAD’s solid-based logic.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary of Key Terms</h3>
    <p>
      To conclude this chapter, here are the most essential takeaways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>3D models are built from geometry—faces, edges, and vertices forming solid, manifold shapes.</li>
      <li>Modeling software varies by purpose: TinkerCAD is ideal for beginners; SketchUp excels in architectural design; FreeCAD is strong for engineering.</li>
      <li>Terms like “extrude,” “boolean,” “mesh,” and “manifold” are not just definitions—they are tools you’ll use in nearly every project.</li>
    </ul>

    Chapter 5: From Sketching to Full Model (Experienced)
  </div>
  <div id="model6" class="collapsible-content">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you’re familiar with the basics, it’s time to dive into one of the most important stages of 3D modeling: sketching.
      Whether you're designing a mechanical part, a custom enclosure, or a piece of art, almost every 3D model begins with a 2D sketch.
      This chapter will guide you through the sketching process using both external tools and the built-in features of the software included in this tutorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll cover how to create precise, purposeful sketches using dimensions and constraints, and then explore how to transform those 2D shapes into full 3D models using common techniques.
      Finally, you’ll try it yourself with a simple sketching exercise inside the software.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Sketching & What Can You Do With It?</h3>
    <p>
      Sketching is the foundation of most 3D models. It involves drawing flat shapes—like rectangles, circles, or custom profiles—that define the outline of your part.
      These shapes are then used to build up your 3D model.
    </p>
    <p>A good sketch can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define the overall shape of your object</li>
      <li>Determine key features like holes, edges, and thickness</li>
      <li>Serve as a base for operations like extrusion, lofting, or cutting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sketches don’t have to be perfect at first—but learning how to control them makes the modeling process faster and more accurate.
    </p>

    <h3>Sketching Tools: External & In the Software</h3>
    <p>
      There are two main ways to start sketching:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>External Tools</strong> – Paper and pencil or digital sketch apps (like Concepts or Procreate) are great for roughing out ideas before moving into CAD.</li>
      <li><strong>In-Software Sketch Tools</strong> – The software provided in this tutorial includes a full set of sketching tools: lines, arcs, rectangles, splines, and more. These tools allow for precise control and are designed to be the starting point for creating solid geometry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll be focusing on the in-software tools going forward.</p>

    <h3>Dimensions & Constraints When Sketching</h3>
    <p>
      To make your sketches functional and parametric, you'll need to apply:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Set the exact size of sketch elements (lengths, angles, diameters).</li>
      <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Lock sketch elements into place relative to each other (e.g., make two lines perpendicular, or make a circle concentric with another shape).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using dimensions and constraints makes your sketches robust and easier to modify later.
    </p>

    <h3>Turning Your 2D Sketch into a 3D Model: Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Once your 2D sketch is complete, you can turn it into a 3D object using various modeling techniques:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Extrude:</strong> Extend the sketch into 3D space by giving it thickness.</li>
      <li><strong>Revolve:</strong> Spin a sketch around an axis to create circular parts.</li>
      <li><strong>Sweep:</strong> Move a sketch along a path (great for pipes or wires).</li>
      <li><strong>Loft:</strong> Blend multiple sketches to create smooth transitions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each method adds a different dimension to your design process.
    </p>

    <h3>Let’s Try It Out: Sketching Exercise</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a base plate with a centered hole.</p>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the sketching workspace and select a flat plane to draw on.</li>
      <li>Draw a rectangle (100mm x 60mm).</li>
      <li>Use dimension tools to set the exact width and height.</li>
      <li>Draw a circle in the center of the rectangle (diameter: 20mm).</li>
      <li>Apply constraints to center the circle both horizontally and vertically.</li>
      <li>Once complete, extrude the sketch to a thickness of 10mm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You now have a simple but complete 3D model—great for practice and easy to print!
    </p>
    <p>
      This exercise builds on everything we’ve covered: creating shapes, applying precision, and transforming a sketch into a printable object.
      With practice, this process becomes second nature and unlocks a whole new level of creativity in your 3D printing workflow.
